# Recommender-Systems-MovieLens

Recommendation systems are one of the most prominent information filtering systems that help companies to understand and to predict user behavior. These systems are
used in a multitude of industries such as e-commerce, social media and movie streaming platforms. For my capstone, I have
set out to study recommender systems and how it works with the most popular recommendation system dataset, MovieLens.
This dataset has been collected and analyzed by the Social Computing Research group at the University of Minnesota known as GroupLens. With some of the most common recommendation system algorithms and machine learning techniques, I have decided to implement a few different recommender models that
will predict movies based on the userâ€™s previous data and users similar to them. What I ended up finding is that understanding the methods of how to evaluate recommendation systems are difficult and few. Among the three models I have created, the system created with the Surprise Library has provided reliable
tools of evaluation and ability to compare performance.

3 Models:
<li>
  <ul>Content-Based Filtering</ul>
  <ul>Memory-Based Collaborative Filtering</ul>
  <ul>Model-Based Collaborative Filtering</ul>
</li>
